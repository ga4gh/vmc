GA4GH Variation Representation Specification
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The Variation Representation Specification (VRS, pronounced "verse") is a standard
developed by the Global Alliance for Genomic Health to facilitate and
improve sharing of genetic information.  The Specification consists of
a JSON Schema for representing many classes of genetic variation,
conventions to maximize the utility of the schema, and a Python
implementation that promotes adoption of the standard.
