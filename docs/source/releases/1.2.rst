Important
#########

  * :ref:`SequenceState is deprecated <deprecations>`. It will be
    removed in VRS 2.0.
  * The first manuscript for VRS has been submitted. Please cite
    https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.15.426843v1.


New classes
###########

  * :ref:`SequenceExpressions <SequenceExpression>` replaces
    SequenceState with more sophisticated expressions such as sequence
    repeats and sequence derived from a location.
  * :ref:`Gene` enables reference to an external definition of a gene,
    particularly for useas a subject of copy number expressions.
  * :ref:`CopyNumber` captures the copies of a molecule within a
    genome, and can be used to express concepts such as amplification
    and copy loss.
  * VRS 1.2 introduces a new classification of variation
    types. :ref:`MolecularVariation` refers to variation within or of
    a contiguous molecular. :ref:`SystemicVariation` refers to
    variation in the context of a system, such as a genome, sample, or
    homologous chromosomes.  :ref:`UtilityVariation` classes provide
    useful representations for certain technical operations.
  * :ref:`NestedInterval` represents imprecise or uncertain locations.


Other data model changes
########################

  * Sequence strings are now formally defined by a :ref:`Sequence`
    type, which is fundamentally also a string.  This change aids
    documentation but has no technical impact.
