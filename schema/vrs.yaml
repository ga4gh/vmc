  CURIE:
    additionalProperties: false
    description: >-
      A string that refers to an object uniquely.  The lifetime and

      VRS does not impose any contraints on strings used as ids in
      messages. However, to maximize sharability of data, VRS
      RECOMMENDS that implementations use [W3C Compact URI
      (CURIE)](https://www.w3.org/TR/curie/) syntax.

      String CURIEs are represented as `prefix`:`reference` (W3C
      terminology), but often referred to as `namespace`:`accession`
      or `namespace`:`local id` colloquially.

      VRS also RECOMMENDS that `prefix` be defined in identifiers.org.

      The `reference` component is an unconstrained string.

      A CURIE is a URI.  URIs may *locate* objects (i.e., specify
      where to retrieve them) or *name* objects conceptually.  VRS uses
      CURIEs primarily as a naming mechanism.

      Implementations MAY provide CURIE resolution mechanisms for
      prefixes to make these objects locatable.

      Using internal ids in public messages is strongly discouraged.
